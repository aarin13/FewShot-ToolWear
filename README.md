# FewShot-ToolWear
A graded project, required for completion of the course Application of AI Robotics, Btech in Robotics and Automation, 2nd year in Symbiosis Institue of Techology, Pune India

Objective of the project was to develop an understanding of the few shot learning method and apply it for prediction of milling machine tool wear.

The dataset used can be found at https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/tool-wear-dataset-nuaaideahouse.
the csv files in the rep are statistical features extracted from the original datasets, using the TSFEL libray; more details can be found here:
